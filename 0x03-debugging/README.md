0x03. C - Debugging
Task 0. Multiple mains In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
1. Like, comment, subscribe

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
